## Hello there üëã
I'm a tech junkie who loves to learn, code and discover new things every day!
And also a Node.js developer :computer:

## About me
* **Name**: Mateus Oliveira
* **Age**: 25
* **Lives in**: S√£o Paulo, BR
* **Stack**: Node.js / MongoDB / Express / REST || GraphQL APIs

## Funfacts
* Earlier this year I worked on Proffy, a fictional platform that helps teachers and students to conect during such difficult times (developed with the help of [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)). It's not operational though!
* üéì I'm currently learning back-end development and will be uploading several small (but good) projects along the way.
* I love functional programming (still learning, and probably will always be). Let's share the knowledge!
* Aiming to give GraphQL the love it deserves.
* :beer:, :tea: and :coffee: will always be on my desk. Not always at the same time.
* :octocat: ‚Üê Look at this smol boy. Isn't he the cutest thing?
* :calling: You can find me @: [Telegram](https://t.me/mateusmlo), Discord @ Bocchi#0681, or [e-mail me](mailto:mateus.mlo95@gmail.com).
