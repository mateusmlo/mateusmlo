# Mateus Oliveira

## Hello there üëã
I'm a tech junkie who loves to learn and discover new things every day!
And also a Node.js developer :computer:


 <br/> :purple_heart: I'm currently working on Proffy, a fictional platform that helps teachers and students to conect during such difficult times (developed with the help of [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)).
 <br/> üéì I'm currently learning back-end development.
 <br/> - I love functional programming (still learning, and probably will always be). Feel free to talk to me about this!
 <br/> - Aiming to give GraphQL the love it deserves.
 <br/> - :beer:, :tea: and :coffee: will always be on my desk. Not always at the same time.
 <br/> - :octocat: ‚Üê Look at this boy. Isn't he the cutest thing?
 <br/> - Pronouns: He/Him || They/Them
 <br/> - :calling: You can find me on Telegram @ mateusmlo, or e-mail me.
 <br/> - I'm still not contributing but will do once I'm comfortable enough with my skills.
