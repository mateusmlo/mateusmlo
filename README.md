## Funfacts
* This document is always a WIP, expect to see something new every once in a while.
* Many of my projects come from MOOCs but they are far from being 1:1 copies, since I refactor, simplify and modernize the code sometimes rewriting almost everything from scratch.
* I'm currently learning back-end development and will be uploading several projects along the way.
* I love functional programming and try to apply concepts whenever possible; expect to see immutable structures and zero *for loops* in my codes (yes I have yet to use Ramda). <del>The academic and advanced stuff still scares me though.</del>
* On the other hand I don't really like Object Oriented Programming (this might change).
* Aiming to give GraphQL the love it deserves.
* :beer:, :tea: and :coffee: will always be on my desk. Not always at the same time.
* Sometimes I write stuff on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mateusmlo) in either PT-BR || EN about mental health and tech.
* :calling: You can find me @: [Telegram](https://t.me/mateusmlo), Discord @ Bocchi#0681, or look at the sidebar for a few more places.
